# Causative

Verbs 「せる・させる」attaching to the あ-stem. 

Means to cause something (by allowing／letting／compelling it).

While usually translated as "allow" or "let", the "cause" in this case can be by whatever means.

Closely related to the receptive and self/other move:
- ある　→　れる・られる（self-move／receiving）
- する　→　せる・させる（other-move／causing）

❕❕❕ Two verbs with separate subjects (same as receptive).

- 食べさせる：
	- 「食べ」first verb done by eater
	- 「させる」done by the eat-causer (who compels／allow eating)
- 犬を食べさせた
	- (I) dog eat caused（core：〇が＋させた）

## Particles

- を：the "object" of the せる・させる
	- An object has no say on the matter (more of a "compel" nuance)
- に：the "target" of the せる・させる
	- Has a more neutral implication (e.g. "allow")
	- Also when the action being caused itself has an を：
		- 犬に肉を食べさせた
		- Japanese does not allow を being used twice

## Causative-receptive

させられる：
- Simple use of the causative + receptive grammar (nothing new)

There are now three verbs on the sentence:
- 〇がブロコリを食べさせられた
- I broccoli eat compel got
	- ①：〇が＋られた　"(I) got"
	- ②：させる　　　　"compel" (actor unspecified)
	- ③：食べる　　　　"(I) eat" (actor 〇)
	- The first and third actor are always the same (obviously)
	- Second actor always different (as expected)
