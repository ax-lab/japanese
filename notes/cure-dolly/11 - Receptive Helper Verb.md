# Receptive helper verb

Meaning of れる／られる：receive or get (attached action)

> あ-stem ＋ れる・られる

The action of the first verb is always done by someone different. Keep them separate:

> The action done by someone else (known or unknown)
> ＋
> Core action "receiving or getting" of that action

## Examples

> 桜が叱られた　　　　Sakura scolded-got
> 水が飲まれた　　　　Water got drunk
> 水が犬に飲まれた　　Water (dog-by drunk)-got

> 桜は誰かにかばんが盗まれた
> About Sakura, her bag got stolen by someone
> (bag "someone-by stolen" got)

れる is a receiving／pull verb (i.e., non-projecting) so に becomes the source (the "target" from which pulling from).

## Suffering passive

迷惑受け身（nuisance receptive）

> 桜が誰かにかばんを盗まれた
> Sakura **got her bag stolen** by someone

The core is "Sakura got". She received the "bag stolen by someone" action.
