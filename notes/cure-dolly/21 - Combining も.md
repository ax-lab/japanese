# Combining （で）も

誰も・何も・誰でも・何でも

## 誰も・何も

Combined with the negative to say nothing
- 誰もいない：there's no one
	- not even someone = no one
- 何もいない：there's nothing
	- not even something = nothing
- 少しもない：not even a little

「も」is the including particle and can also mean "as-much-as (even)"

- 一時間も待た：I waited for as much (even) as one hour

## 誰でも・何でも

- で here is the copula だ in its て-form working kinda like a nominalizing noun (coupled with a zero noun "it")

- 誰でも：any one
	- 誰でもできる：even if it is anyone they can do it
		- でも ＝ "even if it is"
- 何でも：any thing
	- 何でもいい：even if it is anything it is good
- どうでもいい：any how is good

「でも」by itself works the same way:
- で gathers the whole sentence before
- も gives the "even" meaning

For example「かもしれません」"perhaps":
- か：question marker bundle
- も：as-much-as　　
- 知れません：can't know
