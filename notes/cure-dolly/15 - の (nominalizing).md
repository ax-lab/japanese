# の nominalizing function

When の is used to turn a clause into a noun.

Starting from の's fundamental `'s` characteristic:
> マリアのドレスが赤い　　Maria's dress is red
> さくらのが青い　　　　　Sakura's is blue

The 「さくらの」clause is short for 「さくらのもの」(there's a hidden noun there)

> アニメを見るのが楽しい。

The 「アニメを見る」clause has been turned into a noun by の which is actually concealing the hidden generic noun (e.g. 物).

The actual translation would be "the thing of watching anime is fun":

> 〇〇の 〇（もの）が楽しい

The nominalizing の particle is implying a zero pronoun and that is the subject (が) of the sentence.
