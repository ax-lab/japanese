# Verb Transitivity

Traditional western grammar:
- Intransitive: doesn't accept objects.
- Transitive: accept objects. Transitivity is a property of a clause by which activity is transferred from an agent to a patient.

In Japanese (close but not always the same):
- 動詞：move-word = verb
- Self-move:
	- a word that moves itself (e.g. stand-up)
- Other-move:
	- a word that moves another thing (e.g. throw a ball)

Many verbs come into pairs of self / other move forms closely related:
- 出る：leave, exit, come out　／　出す：take out, bring out
- 負ける：lose (be defeated)　／　負かす：defeat (cause to lose)
- Also known as "transitivity pairs"

> ある：mother of self-move  ("be")
> する：father of other-move ("do")

## Rules to identify

1) **する**：す and せる ending verbs are other-move
	- Common える→す transform（出る→出す）
		- Not always：落ちる（fall）　落とす（drop）
	- む：the honorary member of す family
		- む　→　める is always other-move
	- Other members (rare):
		- ぶ　→　べる（other-move）
		- つ　→　てる（other-move）
2) **ある**：あ-stem ＋る ending verbs are self-move
	- Common える→ある transform（上げる→上がる）
	- 上げる：to give something up／上がる：to raise up
		- Exception：包む（wrap）　包まる（exist wrapped）
3) **Flip**: え-stem ＋ る flips self/other move of the base form
	- Flip direction depends on what the base form is
	- Most are む→める where める is always other move. Also:
		- ぶ → べろ　つ → てる
	- Only left: 
		- く／ぐ　→　ける／げる
		- う　　　→　える
		- Some endings not covered by the first two cases
	- Examples:
		- 売る（I sell something）　売れる（I sell like hot cakes）
			- other to self
		- 従う（obey, follow）　従える（subjugate, take along）
			- self to other

## Dictionary exceptions

Note in the example above that 従う is marked as intransitive in the Japanese dictionary (even if you obey or follow something)

- Dictionaries always mark "self-move" as intransitive
- Obey is a transitive self-move verb (self obeys something)
