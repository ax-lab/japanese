# Particles

Logical particles "interrogate" the nouns of the sentence to determine how they relate to each other.

- Logical particles mark the structural functions of nouns in a sentence （が、を、に、へ、で）
- Non-logical topic markers just flag topics. They tell nothing about the structure of the sentence（は、も）
- The と particle just "and" nouns together into any logical function. So it does not have one of its own.
- The と quoting particle takes anything and turns it into a single quasi-noun.

> Logical particles ALWAYS attach to a noun forming an inseparable pair

## Particles in verb sentences

> Only が works in 「A is B」sentences.

- が：who or what did it?
- を：whom was it done to?
- に：where did it go／is／what is the target?
- へ：which direction?
- で：where／with what／how was it done

## Human interaction

Sliding scale of non-mutuality to mutuality:
- を：object (non-mutual)
	- doing something "to" someone (e.g tickle, kill)
- に：target (destination)
	- 誰かに話す：talking to someone (destination)
	- あなたに会いたかった："I want to meet you" as in "see you"
- と：joining (mutual action)
	- 誰かと話す：talking with someone (conversation)
	- あなたと会いたかった："I want us to be together"

Causative: either を or に
- The main actor is in control of the action, so there is no mutual action
