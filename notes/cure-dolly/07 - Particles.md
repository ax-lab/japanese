# Particles

Logical particles "interrogate" the nouns of the sentence to determine how they relate to each other.

- Logical particles mark the structural functions of nouns in a sentence （が、を、に、へ、で）
- Non-logical topic markers just flag topics. They tell nothing about the structure of the sentence（は、も）
- The と particle just "and" nouns together into any logical function. So it does not have one of its own.
- The と quoting particle takes anything and turns it into a single quasi-noun.

> Logical particles ALWAYS attach to a noun forming an inseparable pair

## Particles in verb sentences

> Only が works in 「A is B」sentences.

- が：who or what did it?
- を：whom was it done to?
- に：where did it go／is／what is the target?
- へ：which direction?
- で：where／with what／how was it done
