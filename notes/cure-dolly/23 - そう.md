# そう

Used for likeness and hearsay. Same そう as in こう・そう・ああ・どう meaning "in that way".

For likeness add そう. Becomes an adjectival noun (takes な) meaning "seems like":

- Verbs: use the い-stem connective-use form（連用形)
- Adjectives: replace the い
- Other adjectival nouns: replace the だ・な

For hearsay just add そうだ to an entire sentence.
- そうだ becomes the sentence B engine and the entire sentence its A carriage
- Always means "you heard"

## Examples

- 元気そうな学生：　lively seemingly student
- 静かなそう女の子：quiet looking girl
- 美味しそうだ：　　looks tasty
- 泣きそうだ：　　　seems about to cry
	- With verbs it means the action seems like its about to happen
	
	
❕ Note that Japanese is strict about referring to things we cannot know about (e.g. 美味しいだ for something that has not been eaten), so ～そう is used in those cases.

❕ Colloquially the 「だ」in そうだ is often left off in likeness.

Hearsay:

> さくらが日本人だ**そうだ**
> I heard that Sakura is a Japanese person (it seems = I hear)
