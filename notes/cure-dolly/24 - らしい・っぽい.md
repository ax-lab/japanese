# らしい

Part of a subjectivity しい class of nouns （嬉しい、悲しい、難しい）
- Things that depend on a human impression

Just attaches to a word (verb, noun, adjective) or complete sentence.
- Word ＋ らしい：gives our (subjective) impression of the object, action, or state represented by the word
- Sentence ＋ らしい：indicates that the entire sentence is a "subjectivity" (deduction, hearsay, conjecture...)

Versus そうだ：
- そうだ ＝ hearsay (I heard)
	- あの動物はウサギだそうだ
	- I heard that animal is a rabbit
- らしい ＝ it seems
	- あの動物はウサギだらしい
	- It seems that animal is a rabbit (can mean the same as そう)
- For words: can apply to regular nouns (unlike そう)
	- ウサギらしい：rabbit-like
	- あの動物はウサギらしい
		- That animal is rabbit-like
		- We may or nor be conjecturing that the animal is a rabbit

Qualities of something:
- 男らしい男：manly man
- 先生らしい：teacher-like
	- さくら先生は先生らしい
		- Sakura is a teacher and behaves like a teacher
	- さくら先生は先生らしくない
		- Sakura (teacher) is not teacher-like (does not behave like a proper teacher)
	- それはさくららしくない
		- "That's not like you Sakura"

# っぽい

Also a helper adjective attaching to words only (no clauses).

- らしい tends to imply something has the qualities it ought to have
- っぽい implies the opposite (negative inclination)
	- Not a fast rule

Note the nuance:
- 子供っぽい：childish
- 子供らしい：child-like
