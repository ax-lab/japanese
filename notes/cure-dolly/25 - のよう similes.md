# のよう similes

The other end of the scale from そうだ・らしい（っぽい） similes. From more objective (actual quality) to subjective (metaphor / simile):
- そうだ：hearsay / conjecture
- らしい：observation / quality comparison (also っぽい)
- ようだ：pure simile (also みたい)

(\*) Each level largely contains the functions of the level before it (with subtle distinctions and each functioning best on its own area)

Works as any adjectival noun:
- のようだ：clause-end adjectival
- のような：pre-noun adjectival
- のように：adverb
- Like らしい can work with any noun (making a likening-adjectival or adverb)

Can also be put at the end of whole sentences:
- さくらが来ないようだ
	- It seems Sakura isn't coming
- 少しお酒を飲みすぎだようだ
	- It appears (she) little bit alcohol drank too much
- まるで幽霊を見たか**のような**顔をした
	- "exactly" "ghost saw if" **as** "face did / had"
	- "Did (had) a face exactly as if (she) saw a ghost"
	- Pushes an entire sentence as a simile
	- 

Example similes:
- 山のようだ：　　　is like a mountain
- 風のように走る：　run like the wind

Only よう・みたい can / should be used with まるで（from 丸）
	- まるで：roundly, wholly, completely (signals an hyperbole or metaphor)
		- e.g. "exactly like...", "literally..."
	- まるで風のように走る
	
# みたい

Works pretty much the same as のよう
- Adjectival noun
- Can use まるで
- Less formal
- Cannot be used with a complete sentence to make a simile
	- Needs かような for that
	- Can be used with a complete sentence to conjecture if that statement is the case 
- Since it's casual often will omit the だ・です
