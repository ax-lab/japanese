# か

## Question marker

①　It is the formal question marker:

> お母さんはどこですか。
> Where is (your) mother?

Note that か works differently in casual speech. It is not commonly used to actually make casual questions.

②　Can also turn a logical clause as a "mini-question" inside a sentence (sort like an if, an hypotheses):

> 昨日何を食べたか忘れた。
> Forgot what I ate yesterday.
> 
> 彼は何を言ったか分からない。
> Don’t understand what he said.
> 
> 先生が学校に行ったか教えない？
> Won’t you inform me whether teacher went to school?

Functionally the clause becomes a noun (e.g. can be used with の)

Note __どうか__  "whether or not" is commonly used for yes/no questions:

> 先生学校に行ったか__どうか__知らない。

③　In colloquial use it usually expresses a rhetorical question or sarcasm. Can even throw a sentence into the negative.

> こんなのを本当に食べるか？
> Do you think they will really eat this type of thing?
> 
> そんなのは、あるかよ！
> Do I look like I would have something like that?!

Casual questions use rising intonation and the [の explanatory particle](の).

> こんなのを本当に食べる？
> Are you really going to eat something like this?
> 
> そんなのは、あるの？
> Do you have something like that?
