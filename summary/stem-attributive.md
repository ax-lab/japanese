# 連体形（れんたいけい）(attributive)

The 連体形 is the form of a verb or adjective used to modify a noun (e.g. when using こと or もの after).

> Literal: 連 = to take, to lead + 体 = body + 形 = form

In practice, the standard 連体形 form of verbs and adjectives is the dictionary form. However, alternatives exist, such as the archaic き form of adjectives.
