# も

Inclusive topic particle "also". Like [は](は) but inclusive.

## Even if you do X...

Use the [て-form](・て) ＋ [も](も) to mean "even if you do X...".

## Excessive amount

When the も particle comes after an amount it indicates it is way too much:

> 昨日、電話三回もしたよ！
> I called you like three times yesterday!

> 試験のために三時間も勉強した。
> I studied three whole hours for the exam.

> 今年、十キロも太っちゃった！
