# べく

Grammatically a [conjunctive](stem-masu) form for [べき](べき).

Rare and old-fashioned.

While べき describes a strong suggestion, べく describes what one did to achieve that suggestion.

> 早く帰るべき。
> Should go home early.

> 早く帰るべく、準備をし始めた。
> In trying to go home early, started the preparations.

Somewhat equivalent to 「しようと思って」 or 「できるように」
