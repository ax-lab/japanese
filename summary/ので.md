# ので

## Reason or causation

See also: [から](から), [のに](のに)

Possibly came from の＋だ

Almost interchangeable with から with the subtle difference:
- から is explicitly in its cause/effect
- ので connects sentences with an explanatory tone
	- Sounds softer and slightly more polite
	- Often favored to explain something that is considered discourteous

> ちょっと忙しいので、そろそろ失礼します。

Note that ので requires a な after a noun, the same way as the explanatory [の](の).
