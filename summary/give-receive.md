# Giving and Receiving

See also: [ください](・ください)

# あげる（上げる）

To give something upwards. From the speaker point of view to someone else. The giver is humbly below the receiver.

> 私が友達にプレゼントをあげた。
> I gave present to friend.
> 
> これは先生にあげる。
> I’ll give this to teacher.

With the [て-form](・て) becomes "giving of a favor to `verb`":

> 車を買ってあげるよ。
> I’ll give you the favor of buying a car.
> 
> 代わりに行ってあげる。
> I’ll give you the favor of going in your place.

For the third-person this is used when the speaker is looking at the giver's point of view:

> 学生がこれを先生にあげる。
> The student give this to teacher. (looking at it from the student’s point of view)
> 
> 友達が父にいいことを教えてあげた。
> Friend gave the favor of teaching something good to my dad. 
> (looking at it from the friend’s point of view)

## やる

The verb やる meaning "to do" can be used in place of あげる for pets/animals. For people it is used when looking down on someone and can be offensive.

> 犬に餌をやった？　Did you give the dog food?

# くれる（呉れる）

Can be used to ask for [favors](favors).

To give something downwards. From the receiver point of view. Note 下さる（くださる） which is the honorific version.

> 友達が私にプレゼントをくれた。
> Friend gave present to me.
> 
> これは、先生がくれた。
> Teacher gave this to me.
> 
> 車を買ってくれるの？
> You’ll give me the favor of buying a car for me?
> 
> 代わりに行ってくれる？
> Will you give me the favor of going in my place?

Third person:

> 先生がこれを学生にくれる。
> The teacher give this to student.
> (looking at it from the student’s point of view)
> 
> 友達が父にいいことを教えてくれた。
> Friend gave favor of teaching something good to my dad. 
> (looking at it from the dad’s point of view)

## あげる vs くれる

The usage of あげる vs くれる allows some nuance in some vague sentences:

> 先生が教えてあげるんですか。
> Teacher, will you be the one to give favor of teaching to… [anybody other than the speaker]?

> 先生が教えてくれるんですか。
> Teacher, will you be the one to give favor of teaching to… [anybody including the speaker]?

# もらう（貰う）

To receive （に・から can both be used to indicate the "from"）

The [potential](・える) form can be used to ask for [favors](favors).

Is from the perspective of the receiver. However when used with 私（から・に） emphasizes the fact that the other person received from you, for example: 「あげる："Hey, I gave you that!"」 while 「もらう："Hey, you got that from me!"」.

> 私が友達にプレゼントをもらった。
> I received present from friend.
> 
> 友達からプレゼントをもらった。
> I received present from friend.
> 
> これは友達に買ってもらった。
> About this, received the favor of buying it from friend.
> 
> 宿題をチェックしてもらいたかったけど、時間がなくて無理だった。
> I wanted to receive the favor of checking homework but there was no time and it was impossible.

First person:

> その時計は私からもらったのよ。
> (He) received that watch from me.
