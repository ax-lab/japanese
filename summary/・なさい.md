# ～なさい

Honorific version of する used to make firm but polite [requests](requests).

It is a soft yet firm way of issuing a command (e.g. a mother scolding a child, a teacher commanding a delinquent student to pay attention).

Only applies to the positive. Attaches to the [stem](stem-masu) of the verb.

> よく聞きなさい！　　Listen well!
> ここに座りなさい。　Sit here.

## Casual

You can also drop 「さい」 portion of the 「なさい」 to make a casual version of this grammar:

> まだいっぱいあるから、たくさん食べな。
> There’s still a lot, so eat a lot.
> 
> それでいいと思うなら、そうしなよ。
> If you think that’s fine, then go ahead and do it.

Don't confuse with the negative command [な](・な) (the intonation is different and the verb is complete) or the [な](な) sentence ender.
