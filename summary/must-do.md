# Saying "Must do"

Uses the same grammar as ["must not"](must-not) but negating the verb.

Three forms:
- Negative [て-form](・て) ＋ は ＋ 「だめ・いけない・ならない」
- [Negative verb](ない) ＋ [と conditional](と) ＋ 「だめ・いけない・ならない」
- [Negative verb](ない) ＋ [ば conditional](・ば) ＋ 「だめ・いけない・ならない」

The first method is just the same as "must not" but with negated verb:

> 毎日学校に行かなくてはなりません。
> Must go to school everyday.
> 
> 宿題をしなくてはいけなかった
> Had to do homework.

The second uses the natural conditional. Basically it means that if you don't do something it naturally leads to the fact that it is not good:

> 毎日学校に行かないとだめです。
> Must go to school everyday.
> 
> 宿題をしないといけない
> Have to do homework.

The third method is similar to the second but uses the ば conditional that has a wider range of uses:

> 毎日学校に行かなければいけません。
> Must go to school everyday.
> 
> 宿題をしなければだめだった。
> Had to do homework.

## Reality Check

Note that **～なければ** and **～なくては** are so long that they are not often used in conversations, although they are often used in written context. In practice, conversations often just use the と conditionals or shortcuts below.

## Shortcuts

Those are casual abbreviations for things that must be done:

- なくて becomes [なくちゃ](・なくちゃ.md)
- なければ becomes [なきゃ](・なきゃ.md)

With those abbreviations you can just leave the 「だめ・いけない・ならない」 part out altogether:

> 勉強しなくちゃ。
> Gotta study.
> 
> ご飯を食べなきゃ。
> Gotta eat.

The [と](と) conditional by itself can also imply 「だめ・いけない・ならない」:

> 学校に行かないと。
> Gotta go to school.
