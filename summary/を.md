# を

The direct object particle. Pronounced /o/.

Note that places can be the direct object of motion verbs. The motion is done to the object.

Optional when used with [する](する), so the grammar 「noun ＋ する」 is valid.

Note that when the direct object  is also the topic, we use just the topic flag:

> 日本語を習う　　Learn Japanese
> 日本語は習う　　About Japanese, (will) learn it
