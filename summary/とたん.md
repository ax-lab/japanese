# とたん

"just as"

Expresses an action that occurred immediately after another.

[past tense](・た) ＋ とたん （＋ [に](に)）

The target particle, if present, is targeting that specific moment in time.

> 窓を開けたとたんに、猫が跳んでいった。
> As soon as I opened window, cat jumped out.

Only for things "that happened", not for actions carried by one:

> 映画を観たとたんに、~~トイレに行きました。~~
> (You carried out the action of going to the bathroom so this is not correct.)

> 映画を観たとたんに、眠くなりました。
> (Since becoming sleepy is something that happened outside your control, this sentence is ok.)
