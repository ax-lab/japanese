# ～な

## Negative command form

Attaches to the end of a verb (not the stem). 

Don't confuse:
- With casual form of [～なさい](・なさい) that attaches to the stem and has a different intonation.
- With the sentence ending particle [な](な)

> それを食べるな！　　Don’t eat that!
> 変なことを言うな！　Don’t say such weird things!
