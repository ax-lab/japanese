# About

These are my personal notes on Japanese. My objectives with those notes is to
provide myself with:

- A quick reference for Japanese grammar indexed by the relevant words/stems.
- Detailed notes on different topics, with links to source references.
- Organized collection of useful Japanese resources.
- A dump site for notes on random Japanese media (e.g. lyrics translation exercises).

## Organization

- `grammar`: detailed grammar notes organized by subject
- `notes`: notes for specific lessons from a source material
- `summary`: quick reference organized by word/stem
